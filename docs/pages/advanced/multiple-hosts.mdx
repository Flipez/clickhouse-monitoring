# Multiple Hosts

![](/multiple-hosts.png)

You can configure the UI to have multiple ClickHouse hosts by using these environment variables:

- `CLICKHOUSE_HOST`: Separated by commas, for example: `http://ch-1:8123,http://ch-2:8123`
- `CLICKHOUSE_NAME`: (Optional) Name of the ClickHouse instance, must match the number of hosts in `CLICKHOUSE_HOST`, for example `ch-1,ch-2`.

All these hosts will share the same `CLICKHOUSE_USER` and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`. If you want to have multiple users/passwords for each host, specify them in the usual way:

- `CLICKHOUSE_USER`: `user1,user2`
- `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`: `password1,password2`
